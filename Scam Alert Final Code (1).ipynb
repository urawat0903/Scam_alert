They required me to purchase money cards to verify my bank account information and a fee for insurance to pay for an unsecured loan. They cashed my money cards but I never received any funds.  I have reported it to the FL Attorney General, the Florida Office of Financial Regulation and Better Business Bureau. No funds have been recovered as yet.</td></tr><tr><td>Assisted Living/Nursing Homes</td><td>Lifespace Communities has many facilities for Seniors and I and thousands of others call for information. After, a few calls, and discussions, I received a bill for 30.00 euro. I called and we laughed about it being a mistake. However, a few months later another bill came only higher, late payment fees. Now, today 7 months and the bill is 282.00+ Euro. If 1500 calls go in, and 20% of the people get on this billing system this equals 90,000euro in 7 months and growing monthly. I telephoned and asked for CEO, CFO and no one responded. I believe bills are going out to Seniors and many are paying. Can you investigate and find out what is happening and stop this. Delray and Waterford and Harbours Edge are pricey, 170,000 no return after 4 years on the funds you put down. And, many extras when you visit. I spent time at one and was shocked, they had no doctors, no nurses and I was to hire a Concierge Dr. to help and they would call should I have a problem. I had two people with me who can be witnesses. It is called a Social Senior Living, but they have Alzheimers care and thus receive federal funding. There were 27 apartments sold after a year and the Alzheimers were filled. The down payment, then has a monthly fee of 3400. for 15 meals a month, and linen service. This is a rip off for Seniors. </td></tr><tr><td>Auto Sales/Repairs</td><td>I was called and talked into an extended warranty for my car.VEHICLE PROTECTION SPECIALISTS, out of Irvine , CA.  After reading the policy I opted to cancel, they refunded my initial $100. However 30 days later they illegally entered my account and stole $140.56! They claim that I never cancelled. Well I told them repeatedly, and they gave me back my initial $100. I had to close my bank account. Report to BBB, but no real resolution. Honestly don't know what the BBB is for.</td></tr><tr><td>Banks and Lenders</td><td>My  39 year old son was contacted by phone by a supposed member of the TD Bank Fraud Department. He was told that they saw suspicious activity on his account in Atlanta, GA. He verified that he was not in Atlanta and in a panic he allowed them to extract his debit card number, PIN and the last 4 of his SS#. Within two minutes they pulled the $300 balance in his account AND they started using his cell phone number as well. He did manage to close down his account and had Verison issue him another.</td></tr><tr><td>Charitable Solicitations</td><td>I found it odd that they would send a pair of gloves with a dream catcher when they asked for money for hats gloves  extra...

The analyst connected me to NYIT Solutions, LLC in Florida. The NYIT operators sounded foreign and they charged me $1196 for a 2 year monitoring.  Later on they charged me an additional $2500 for firewalls.</td></tr><tr><td>Credit Bureaus & Credit Reporting</td><td>Received a fraudulent Pre-Legal Notification regarding a Neiman Marcus Credit Card bill.

She had last 4 of my social, last 4 of my card, and my address (she read them to me). I said the charges were fraud, and she said ok, will close that card, but needed me to verify my PIN (the one you use at an ATM). I refused. Called phone number on back of card, bank confirmed this is fraud. Don't trust caller ID. </td></tr><tr><td>Electronics Products</td><td>I placed an order for an HP Laptop.   The day it arrived I received an email from HP with the original order date and order number stating that there was a faulty circuit board in the laptop and I should use the attached Pre-paid return label to return the laptop and a new one was on the way.   The return email was HP@engineer.com so I was suspicious. Even though it looked very authentic I called HP.  It was a scam and the address to return was not their address.\r</td></tr><tr><td>Employment</td><td>Received contact through email stating that she was hiring manager at Nuix.  The position required work at home equipment and training.  Pay rate $27/HR.  A check was sent for the amount.  Hiring manager and CPA wanted copy of deposit slip.

There wasn't really anything I wanted but I picked a neck massager and then was told I needed to pay shipping which was $3.19. I thought what the heck and paid it with my credit card. On my  statement was a charge of $19.99 from Tactical Flashlight in Florida. I called that # and was told by getting the a free gift I had signed up for a membership a to receive something every month. I raised Cain and was told they would cancel it and gave me a cancellation number and said they would send me a free gift for my trouble. Told them I didn't  want it, they sent it anyway. Well, lo and behold my  statement has another charge of $19.99 on it.</td></tr><tr><td>Government</td><td>Voicemail left on landline saying that our social security number was suspended due to illegal activity.  They left phone number for us to return call. They said FBI and Homeland Security would be contacting us.\r</td></tr><tr><td>Grants</td><td>I received a call, from New York, that the caller stated I'd won a $9000.00 grant from the gov't.

The service man looked at my water heater and advised me that I needed a thermostat and that my tank needed to be modified with a pressure regulator valve and an expansion tank. The two parts would be a total of $831.00.  My daughter checked the web and found we could get the two items for under $50.00. I contacted the plumbing co and told them this and they continued to try and convince me that I needed these things before they could fix the heating problem.  I decided to call the Philadelphia Gas Works to ask questions and a service representative came to my home and checked the hot water tank and said the pilot was out he lit the pilot and I now have hot water after not having hot water for a week.  I feel the Grade A plumbing Co was trying to take advantage of me and I would like to alert others so that they fall into their trap.  The Philadelphia Gas Works advised me that I did not need an expansion tank or a pressure regulator valve they are needed in my larger homes or buildings like mansions\r</td></tr><tr><td>Housing Issues/Living Arrangements</td><td>Girl was suppose to come stay with me as a student and paid a company check for 3 months in advance then she kept texting me wants some money back to move to Lansing.  So I wire transfer the money to her account in Virginia bank. I got all her information so I went and transferred $3100 from my bank. Next day I found out it was fraud and tried to stop wire transfer but bank refused to do that. Then found out company check was bounced\r</td></tr><tr><td>Identity Theft</td><td>I received a Facebook message from a trusted, military friend. She asked if I'd received info from the Agency group yet, that she saw my name on the award list. She said I should contact the agency group and gave me a cell number to text. Again, the persons name used was a trusted friend and they even had her picture so I went with it and texted the number she provided.

Now, today 7 months and the bill is 282.00+ Euro. If 1500 calls go in, and 20% of the people get on this billing system this equals 90,000euro in 7 months and growing monthly. I telephoned and asked for CEO, CFO and no one responded. I believe bills are going out to Seniors and many are paying. Can you investigate and find out what is happening and stop this. Delray and Waterford and Harbours Edge are pricey, 170,000 no return after 4 years on the funds you put down. And, many extras when you visit. I spent time at one and was shocked, they had no doctors, no nurses and I was to hire a Concierge Dr. to help and they would call should I have a problem. I had two people with me who can be witnesses. It is called a Social Senior Living, but they have Alzheimers care and thus receive federal funding. There were 27 apartments sold after a year and the Alzheimers were filled. The down payment, then has a monthly fee of 3400. for 15 meals a month, and linen service. This is a rip off for Seniors.</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>Auto Sales/Repairs</td>\n      <td>I was called and talked into an extended warranty for my car.VEHICLE PROTECTION SPECIALISTS, out of Irvine , CA.
